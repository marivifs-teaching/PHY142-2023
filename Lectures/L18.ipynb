    "[Ampere's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp√®re's_circuital_law) is a useful way to determine magnetic field in cases where symmetry makes it practical. It is valid in cases where the magnetic field is static, or in other words when steady currents flow. It also does not apply when magnetic materials are present. (It can however be modified to deal with both changing currents and magnetic materials).\n",
