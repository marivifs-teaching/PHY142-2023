    "In a ferromagnet the magnetic dipoles interact very strongly with each other and therefore arrange themselves in the same direction, giving the material a magnetization even when no magnetic field is applied. As field is applied in the direction of the magnetization it only increases a little until the saturation magnetization $M_{C}$ is reached The direction of the magnetization can be reversed by application of a magnetic field in the opposite direction to the magnetization which exceeds a certain value, $H_{C}$ the coercive field. These properties give rise to the phenomenon of magnetic [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis).\n",

    "In a ferromagnet the mangetic dipoles would always like to all point in the same direction, but frequently we see that a ferromagnetic material does not appear to be magnetized. This occurs because the material can split into ferromagnetic [domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_domains), and while in each domain all the dipoles point in the same direction, the overall direction of each domain can be different. When a ferroelectric material which initially has zero net magnetization, due to domains, is placed in a magnetic field it shows a different $M-H$ curve until it is fully magnetized after which hysteresis is observed. The driving force behind the formation of the domains is the energetic drive to minimize the external magnetic field around the sample. \n",
