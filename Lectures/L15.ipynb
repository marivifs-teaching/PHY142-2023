The magnetic field of the earth is also important in shielding the earth from cosmic radiation. We should note that the magnetic North Pole is actually a magnetic south pole, and the magnetic South Pole is actually a magnetic north pole.\n",

    "The Earth's magnetic poles move around, and in fact can flip their direction completely. This might suggest to us that the magnetic field, unlike in our bar magnet, is due to some kind of dynamic process. In fact the Earth's magnetic field is due to electric currents in the outer liquid core. So we should discuss how an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field. \n"
