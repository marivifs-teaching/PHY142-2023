    "\n",
    "**PHY141/142 Honors Classical Physics** is the honors section of a fast-paced, two-semester long, survey of classical physics, primarily for students\n",
    "majoring in Physics, Mathematics, or Engineering. Topics for the first semester include classical mechanics, oscillations and (sound) waves, fluids, and\n",
    "thermodynamics. The second semester discusses electricity, DC and AC currents, magnetism and electromagnetic waves, light, optics, and a few topics in\n",
    "modern physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course has three 55-minute lectures per week with quizzes and assigned homework. Homework (online) will be graded and counts towards the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Co-requisite for PHY141 is PHY133. Co-requisite for PHY142 is PHY134; MAT 132 or 142 or 127 or 171 or AMS 161. Prerequisite for PHY142: a grade of\n",
    "C+ or higher in PHY141 or permission of the department.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the course covers all of classical physics in only two semesters, students should expect a **heavy workload**. To succeed this course, students should be well-prepared and should expect to devote about **8-12 hr/week** to homework and laboratory preparation."

The class/course code is PHY142S23 (fernandez-serra95733). If you have a valid access (MasteringPhysics access remains valid for 3 semesters), just use your existing password and register for the class. You are encouraged to discuss HW problems with your colleagues. However, you only hurt yourself if you simply copy answers. It is to your own benefit that we assign carefully chosen HW problems so you can exercise your knowledge and gain better understanding: true understanding only comes via solving real-world problems (as I hope you know by now), and HW problems reflect (pieces of) real-world problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Exam problems will be based on Quizzes, Lecture examples, and HW problems, so fully understanding the solutions is key to passing this course. Therefore, it is crucial (even if HW only counts for a small fraction of the course grade), that you do all problems on your own (even after having discussed them at length with colleagues or TAs). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Beware: in the past, we have seen excellent correlation between success in HW and success in the exams. There are, however, a few outliers - poor course results with almost perfect HW scores - and we strongly suspect (reviewing the other course components in these cases) that these are instances of blindly copied HW solutions."
